# tonto - Professor Roch's not too smart strategy
# You are not given source code to this, but compiled .pyc files
# are available for Python 3.7 and 3.8 (fails otherwise).
# This will let you test some of your game logic without having to worry
# about whether or not your AI is working and let you pit your player
# against another computer player.
#
# Decompilation is cheating, don't do it.  Big sister is watching you :-)

# Python cand load compiled modules using the imp module (deprecated)
# We'll format the path to the tonto module based on the
# release of Python.  Note that we provided tonto compilations for Python 3.7
# and 3.8.  If you're not using one of these, it won't work.
